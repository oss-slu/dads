# Information Radiator Documentation of DADS Project

### Objective
This Information Radiator is designed to give a clear, open and live picture of how the DADS project is doing. This is in line with Agile and Obeya principles since everyone in the team and among stakeholders will know the progress during a sprint, the level of team collaboration and key achievements.

### Value Of the Each Component
The following is a description of every implemented component and its importance for the team’s workflow and goals.

#### 1. Sprint Progress
With this card, we can quickly know the number of tasks that are completed compared to those that were assigned during the present sprint. That way, the team can see the work left to do and check how far it have come. It makes information clearer and helps with organizing the sprints better.

#### 2. Open Issues
This part shows the current number of open issues in GitHub. It helps you find out how many tasks are left and allows you to handle them more efficiently. The team is updated in real time about any pending bugs or features through the GitHub API.

#### 3. Closed Issues
This card expresses situations that have previously been settled and closed. It allows the team to see how productive they are by showing what they have managed to finish during a sprint.

#### 4. Team Health Indicator
Three colors (Green, Yellow, Red) are used on the Team Health card to show the team’s condition. Such information can be added manually, but it lets team members communicate issues without disrupting the meeting which is in line with Obeya’s approach to managing the whole team.

#### 5. Team Contributions(Commits)
The number of GitHub commits by each team member is used to calculate all the contributions on this card. It shows you who has made recent changes and who could benefit from some assistance during retrospectives.

#### 6. Improvement Notes
In this section, the team is able to keep up with the outcomes or actions identified from previous meetings and retrospectives. It helps companies grow by constantly pursuing better results and educating employees about previous errors.

#### 7. Team Availability
The Team Availability card tracks who is available or unavailable on a given day/week. This improves planning and reduces miscommunication, especially during critical phases like sprint review or deployment.

#### 8. Celebration & Recognition
The text in this section appreciates the team for finishing main tools or fixing tough issues. Making achievements visible encourages the team and supports a good work environment.

### Alignment with Obeya Principles
The design and content of this Information Radiator align with the core principles of Obeya:
- **Visual Management :** All the data is presented clearly on the cards.
- **Single Source of Truth :** Real Time data is pulled directly from the GitHub API, it reduceing the manual reporting.
- **Team Empowerment :** The raditor gives the team ownership over progress, blockers of the project.
- **Flow of work :** Sprint progress, issue status, and availability help visualize workflow it makes easier to spot obstacles in work. 
- **Performance & Health :** By combining metrics like commits and issues, and team health indicators, the radiator balances output with well-being.

### Real Time Updates
All GitHub-dependent parts of the page like open issues, closed Issues, commits are filled in real time as new information becomes available. Some parts like Health, Improvement Notes, Availability are managed directly by the team and these fields can be filled out as is fitting.
