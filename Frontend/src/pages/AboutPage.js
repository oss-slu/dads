                    The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive database of arithmetic dynamical systems and a flexible, web-based, search-driven user interface. The web-based interface to access the data will be search-driven making tasks such as locating examples with specific properties or examining the collective statistics of certain sets of dynamical systems as simple as possible. This data will be able to be exported for further analysis. This type of searchable rich data set will save researchers countless hours of computation as well as provide a means to identify previously unknown patterns and connections.

                          Lucien Szpiro conjectured a relationship between the conductor and discriminant of an elliptic curve (two fundamental numerical invariants associated to an elliptic curve). As rational points on elliptic curves can be thought of as a special case of a dynamical system, one would hope to make a more general version of Szpiro's conjecture. Conjecture 4.97 in Silverman's The Arithmetic of Dynamical Systems gives one such possibility looking at the powers which occur in the prime divisors of the minimal resultant of a dynamical system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Essentially, this conjecture says that the powers of the primes that occur in the factorization of the minimal resultant are bounded above by a constant c that does not depend on the function (only on the degree of the function). However, this version is known to be false. Consequently, a more refined notion of conductor and/or resultant needs to be formulated. The information in the database could be used as test data to quickly examine possible reformulations, or advanced AI tools could be used on the database itself to predict a reformulation.

                          <Tab.Pane eventKey="#link3">An area of recent research is understanding how similar a given algebraic map over a finite field is to a random map. A truly random map would have equal probability of any point being the forward image of any other. The statistics on the dynamical data associated to truly random maps have been extensively studied due to their connections to problems in computer science, e.g., Pollard Rho factoring or psuedo-random number generators. It is well known that an underlying group structure, such as for Lattes maps or Chebyshev polynomials, has a profound effect on the statistics. More subtly it appears that the size of the function's automorphism group affects the statistics of the map. It is these types of subtle connections that only become visible in large datasets and could be identified through analysis of the data contained in the database.</Tab.Pane>

                          <Tab.Pane eventKey="#link4">Besides performing statistical analysis of the data for a large class of maps, researchers often want to restrict their attention to special families of maps. For example, Lattes maps have received significant attention. A researcher studying Lattes maps would benefit from being able to instantly determine a list of all Lattes maps satisfying certain properties (such as bounded height) and be able to export that list to a format that is immediately usable in Sage or another computer algebra system. That database can both return statistical information about those families of maps and export the search results.</Tab.Pane>
