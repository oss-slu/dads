## DADS: A Database of Arithmetical Dynamic Systems
DADS is a web application designed for researchers to access information about a vast array of arithmetical dynamical systems that would otherwise take a long time to compute independently. This project was developed by the SLU Capstone Project team under Open Source with SLU in collaboration with Dr. Benjamin Hutz, a professor of mathematics and statistics at Saint Louis University.

### Features
* Home Page: A description of the application and a link to the GitHub repository.
* Explore Systems Page: Allows users to filter and query through the database for various properties like automorphism group cardinality and degree. The results are displayed in a paginated data table with a statistics summary to the right which shows metrics about the returned systems, such as average height.
* System Details Page: Each system in the paginated table has a label which can be selected to show a page with additional information about the system.

### Tech Stack
* Frontend: React
* Backend: Python
* Database: PostgreSQL

### Getting Started
* Clone the repository from GitHub.
* Install the necessary dependencies for React and Python using PIP and npm install.
* Set up the PostgreSQL database.
* Run the application using <code>python server.py</code> and <code>npm start</code> commands in backend and frontend directories respectively. 
* Please see the installation guide for more details.

### Key Files

#### Backend - 
- postgres_connector.py - Contains methods to select systems and build SQL query text
- server.py - Contains Flask server initialization and API routes4

#### Frontend - 
- ExploreSystems.js - This page allows users to filter and search through the dynamical systems database using various properties.
- SystemDetails.js - Displays detailed information about a specific system when selected from the results in the Explore Systems page, uses component tables and data passed from postgres_connector
- AboutPage.js - Contains static information about the site
- newDataTable.js - Renders a dynamic table that displays systems based on the search and filter criteria, complete with pagination functionality.
