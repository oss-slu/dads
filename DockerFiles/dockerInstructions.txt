Install Docker Desktop (https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)

Open CMD as admin, navigate to folder with Dockerfile

Run "docker build -t NAME_OF_IMAGE ./"

Run "docker run --name dadscontainer -v SOME_FILE_PATH/pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data -p 5432:5432 NAME_OF_IMAGE"

Navigate to the File path provided in the previous step, then into the new pgdata folder

Paste data.csv (Our test data) into this folder

In a new cmd window run "docker exec -it dadscontainer psql -U postgres -d dynamSystems

This should give a shell within the docker container

In this shell, run "\copy data FROM '/var/lib/postgresql/data/data.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;"


This should get the database setup and populated. Now you should be able to connect using this info
Host: localhost
Port: 5432
User: postgres
Password: docker
Database Name: dynamSystems
Table Name: public.data

You'll only need to follow these inital steps the very first time you set it up, after that you should be able to just restart the container by using 

docker start NAME_OF_CONTAINER 

in a cmd, and the database should persist
